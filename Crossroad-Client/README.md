## Development server

First ensure that backend API service is running first (C# Web API). Ensure that the port number where the C# service is running is same as the one specified in environment.ts (environment/environment.prod.ts) on config called **crossroadApiUrl:**. If it's not same port, make sure to update environment file to use port where service is running.  

After that,  run `npm install`. After this, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project for production deployment. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

No tests were created other than the ones that were scaffolded by Angular CLI.
